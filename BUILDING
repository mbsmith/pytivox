To compile, you will need XCode installed.

  First, obtain ffmpeg, and compile it
  Put the resulting ffmpeg binary into "External Software/ffmpeg"
  Put the 5 shared libs into "External Software/libavutil.dylib" (etc.. by name)

  Get the python imaging library, and put it in "PIL/"
  
  Then load up the project, and build it.  

  The source does not include the distribution key, so build only the "Release" build.  If you want to build a full distribution you will need to get the key from me, or generate your own (in which case, auto-update will refuse your build).

   To read up more on the keys, look at the Sparkle homepage.
