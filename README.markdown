## pyTivoX
pyTivoX lets you play movies from your mac to your tivo. It is a free replacement for the upload feature of
Tivo Desktop Plus. (Look at iTiVo for the download features).

pyTiVoX only runs on OSX 10.5 (Leopard) and up.
It is aimed at users of Series 2, Series 3, and TivoHD machines.
It includes both [pyTivo](http://pytivo.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/PyTivo) and [StreamBaby](http://code.google.com/p/streambaby/).
